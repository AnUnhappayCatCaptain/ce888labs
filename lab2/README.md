## Introduction
A business is looking at changing their current vehicle fleet and replacing their vehicles with ones used by their competitors. They are have captured the MPG of some of the cars in both fleets fleets.    
## Scaterplot & Histogram
1. A scaterplot has been created and shown below.  
![scaterplot](./scaterplotv.png?raw=true)  
2. Histograms of current fleets and new fleets has been created and shown below.  
![histogram_of_current](./histogramv_C.png?raw=true)  
![histogram_of_new](./histogramv_N.png?raw=true)  
## Analysis
A set of variables has been calculated to give analysis of the data.  
  
variables of current fleets:  
Mean of current fleets: 20.144578  
Median of current fleets: 19.000000  
Var of current fleets: 40.983113  
std of current fleets: 6.401805  
MAD of current fleets: 4.000000  
  
variables of new fleets:  
Mean of new fleets: 30.481013  
Median of new fleets: 32.000000  
Var of new fleets: 36.831918  
std of new fleets: 6.068931  
MAD of new fleets: 4.000000
